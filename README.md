# pneumatic-control-system
I programmed a pneumatic control system using the ESP32 and Arduino IDE. The ESP32 manages valve operations based on input signals, enabling precise control of pneumatic actuators. This project helped me learn about real-time control, automation, and integrating electronics with mechanical systems.
